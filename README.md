## Course Summary
- Big-O, Omega, Theta Notation
- Greedy Algorithms:
  - A choice is called safe when there's an optimal solution consistent with this first choice
  - Not all first choices are safe
  - Greedy choices are often unsafe
- Divide and Conquer:
  - The run time of linear search is θ(*n*), while the run time of binary search is θ(log *n*)
  -
