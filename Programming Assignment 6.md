### 6.1. Maximum Amount of Gold
**Task:** Given *n* gold bars, find the maximum weight of gold that fits into a bag of capacity *W*.\
**Input Format:** The first line of the input contains the capacity *W* of a knapsack and the number *n* of bars of gold. The next line contains *n* integers *w<sub>0</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>, ..., w<sub>n-1</sub>* defining the weights of the bars of gold.\
**Constraints:** *1 ≤ W ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>*; *1 ≤ n ≤ 300*; *0 ≤ w<sub>0</sub>, ..., w<sub>n-1</sub> ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>*\.
**Output Format:** Output the maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack of capacity *W*.
